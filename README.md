User-level data: How a user first found the website = traffic_source 

Session-level data: Which channels and campaigns drove traffic to the website at a session level = session_traffic_source_last_click 

Event-level data: The source and medium that drove traffic to those individual pages. If multiples sources drive the same user to the website during the session = collected_traffic_source and event_parmas
